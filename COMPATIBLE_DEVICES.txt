ESP32 Compatible BLE Devices
============================

This project only lists devices that advertise manufacturer data with company
identifier `0xFFFF` and start their payload with the ASCII bytes `BLE`.

To create a compatible ESP32 device:

1. Use an ESP32 BLE library such as NimBLE-Arduino or ESP-IDF.
2. When advertising, include the manufacturer data:
   - Company Identifier: 0xFFFF (reserved for testing)
   - Data payload prefix: 0x42 0x4C 0x45 ('BLE')
3. Optionally expose any GATT services and characteristics you wish. The app
   will read values from any supported characteristics (e.g., Battery Level,
   Temperature, Humidity, Heart Rate) when available, but none are required for
   a device to be considered compatible.
4. Update characteristic values as your sensors change.
5. Ensure the device advertises while disconnected so it can be discovered.

Devices following these guidelines will appear in the scan dialog and their
characteristic values will populate widgets in the dashboard when those
services are present.
