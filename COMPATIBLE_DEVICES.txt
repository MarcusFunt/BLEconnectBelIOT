ESP32 Compatible BLE Devices
============================

This project only lists devices that advertise manufacturer data with company
identifier `0xFFFF` and start their payload with the ASCII bytes `BLE`.

To create a compatible ESP32 device:

1. Use an ESP32 BLE library such as NimBLE-Arduino or ESP-IDF.
2. When advertising, include the manufacturer data:
   - Company Identifier: 0xFFFF (reserved for testing)
   - Data payload prefix: 0x42 0x4C 0x45 ('BLE')
3. Expose the following services and characteristics:
   - Battery Service (0x180F) with Battery Level characteristic (0x2A19)
   - Health Thermometer (0x1809) with Temperature characteristic (0x2A6E)
   - Environmental Sensing (0x181A) with Humidity characteristic (0x2A6F)
4. Update characteristic values as your sensors change.
5. Ensure the device advertises while disconnected so it can be discovered.

Devices following these guidelines will appear in the scan dialog and their
characteristic values will populate widgets in the dashboard.
